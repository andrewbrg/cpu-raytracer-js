# Raytracing on the CPU in JavaScript
This project is a very very simple ray tracer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)) written in pure JS and runnable in a web browser thanks to the use of an HTML Canvas.

It's written manner which is not so optimized for performance but on the other hand more readily readable by humans in order to facilitate the understanding of the underlying code and math. To get started simply download the project and run `demo.html`.

_*based on a literate raytracer in javascript http://macwright.org/literate-raytracer/_
